Q4.Write a Maple program to propose a more suitable system of election for Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka (A proper system to select members to the Sri Lankan Parliament). You must propose your
system based on the following observations.
3
(a) A mixed system, a hybrid of the first past the post system and the

the expansions of (x + y)^k
for k = 0...n, where x and y are real
variables.

numerical coefficients of the expansions of (x+y)^k
for k = 0...n.
Test your procedures for few n values.
